        <h3>Brief history of Man City</h3>
        <p> Manchester City Football Club, also known as Man City, was founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton). The club changed its name to Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and then to Manchester City in 1894. 

            Manchester City has a long and storied history. The club has won numerous domestic and international titles, including six English League Championships, seven FA Cups, and three League Cups. The club's most successful period came in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when they won the English League Championship, the FA Cup, and the European Cup Winners' Cup.
            
            In the 1980s and 1990s, the club experienced a decline in their fortunes both on and off the pitch, culminating in relegation to the third tier of English football in 1998. However, the club quickly bounced back and returned to the Premier League in 2002, under the ownership of former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.
            
            In 2008, Manchester City was purchased by the Abu Dhabi United Group, and the club's fortunes were transformed. The new owners invested heavily in the club, bringing in top-class players and managers, and Manchester City soon emerged as one of the leading teams in English and European football. 
            
            Under the management of Pep Guardiola, Manchester City has enjoyed unprecedented success in recent years, winning four Premier League titles in five seasons, as well as numerous domestic cups and reaching the final of the UEFA Champions League in 2021. Today, Manchester City is one of the wealthiest and most successful football clubs in the world.</p>
